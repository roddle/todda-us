    Spaces FTW

    In prototype: Stuff.prototype.work = ...
Multi-line lists (arrays, objects, arguments)

    That is inherently evil

    Mixed, as necessary

    Pure JS
Array length caching
    Preprocessor handles this for me

    Both
Array iteration
    Indexed (for i=0 or while)

    Using an abstraction: extend(Child, Parent) or similar

    Underscore(s) at the beginning
Variable declaration
    At the beginning of a function
Object iteration
    Functional ($.each or similar)
